## üè• Features

- **Disease Prediction**: ML-based disease prediction using patient symptoms and medical data
- **Doctor Recommendations**: Intelligent doctor recommendations based on disease, location, and distance
- **Medicine Recommendations**: Medicine suggestions based on predicted diseases
- **Location-Based Search**: Find doctors nearest to your location using GPS coordinates
- **Disease Accuracy Tracking**: View prediction accuracy for each disease type
- **Disease Information**: Comprehensive information about various diseases

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Generate Data

```bash
python data_generator.py
```

This will create synthetic medical data in the `data/` directory:
- `medical_data.csv` - Patient data with symptoms and diseases
- `doctors.csv` - Doctor information with specializations
- `medicines.csv` - Medicine data with disease mappings

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
python disease_predictor.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the medical data
- Train multiple ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Evaluate model performance
- Save the best performing model

### 4. Run the Web Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

                                      top_n=5)

for doctor in doctors:
    distance = doctor.get('distance_km', 'N/A')
    print(f"{doctor['name']} - {doctor['specialization']} - {distance:.1f} km away")

# Find nearby doctors within radius
nearby_doctors = recommender.recommend_doctors_nearby(40.7128, -74.0060, 
                                                     radius_km=50,
